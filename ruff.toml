# A Cool Ruff Configuration | https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff
# ===================================================================================
#
# This file is a comprehensive Ruff configuration that enforces a strict, modern,
# and consistent Python coding style. It's designed to be a "one-stop shop"
# for linting and formatting, replacing Black, isort, flake8, and many plugins.
#
# To use it, place this file as `ruff.toml` or `.ruff.toml` in your project root.
# You can also merge it into your `pyproject.toml` under the `[tool.ruff]` section.
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Core Settings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Set the minimum Python version to target. Ruff will not suggest features
# that are unavailable in this version. "py38" is a safe, modern default.
target-version = "py311"

# A list of file patterns to include when linting.
# By default, Ruff lints *.py, *.pyi, and pyproject.toml.
# Adding `*.ipynb` is great for projects with Jupyter Notebooks.
include = ["*.py", "*.pyi", "pyproject.toml", "*.ipynb"]

# A list of file patterns to exclude from linting and formatting.
# This extends Ruff's default exclusions with common project folders.
extend-exclude = [
    ".mypy_cache",
    ".pytest_cache",
    "docs/",
    "site/",
    "htmlcov/",

# Enable preview mode to opt in to the latest rules, formatter style changes,
# and other unstable features. This is for those who like to live on the edge!
preview = true

# The line length to aim for. Ruff's default of 88 is the same as Black's.
line-length = 88


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Formatter Settings (Replaces Black)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[format]
# Use double quotes for strings. Options: "double", "single".
quote-style = "double"

# Use spaces for indentation. Options: "space", "tab".
indent-style = "space"

# Respect magic trailing commas. When this is `false` (like Black), a trailing
# comma on an expression indicates it should be expanded onto multiple lines.

# Automatically detect the appropriate line ending. Options: "auto", "lf", "crlf".
line-ending = "auto"

# Linter Rule Selection (The Heart of Ruff)

    # --- Core & Essential Checks ---
    "E",   # pycodestyle errors
    "W",   # pycodestyle warnings
    "F",   # Pyflakes (catches undefined names, unused imports, etc.)

    # --- Import Sorting & Styling (replaces isort) ---
    "I",   # isort

    # --- Modernization & Best Practices ---
    "UP",  # pyupgrade (upgrades syntax to newer Python versions)
    "B",   # flake8-bugbear (finds likely bugs and design problems)
    "C4",  # flake8-comprehensions (helps write more idiomatic comprehensions)
    "SIM", # flake8-simplify (simplifies complex code structures)

    # --- Security & Robustness ---
    "S",   # flake8-bandit (finds common security issues)
    "A",   # flake8-builtins (prevents shadowing Python builtins)
    "PTH", # flake8-use-pathlib (enforces using `pathlib` over `os.path`)
    "TRY", # tryceratops (rules for exceptional exception handling)

    # --- Naming, Docstrings, and Readability ---
    "N",   # pep8-naming
    "D",   # pydocstyle (enforces docstring conventions)
    "T20", # flake8-print (flags `print` and `pprint` calls)

    # --- Ruff-specific Rules ---
    "RUF", # Ruff's own rules, often for performance or clarity

    "D104",  # Missing docstring in public package.
